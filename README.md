# SwiftUIExtensions

A small grab bag of my extensions and utilities for SwiftUI.

Right now, the things in here are mostly focussed at allowing the same code to build for macOS/iOS/tvOS targets.

This involves adding some abstractions and shims to gloss over platform differences.


### Scope and Stability

In general I prefer to have more focussed packages, so as things in here become more substantial I'll probably move them out into their own packages.  As such, it's probably not a good idea to rely on this API being particularly stable.

It's always helpful to have somewhere to dump "the other stuff" however - this is that place for my miscellaneous SwiftUI code.
